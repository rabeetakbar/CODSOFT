# CODSOFT
I have completed 3 tasks of the CodSoft internship, all these can be just downloaded and you can use them even without IDE
About To-Do-list:
it has 4 options and keeps on giving you options until you select quit, it adds your tasks to an array and also allows you to remove once the task is done.
About Calculator:
its a simple and basic calculator which works on 2 numbers only it can be either floating point numbers or integers and
it will give you four basic arithmetic operations to operate on these numbers.
About Password generator:
it asks the user to enter length of password and then generates a random password of that length.

**All these programs are easy to use and can be simply used without any IDE. All you need is a PC that have python installed.**
